Cryptocurrency Anomaly Detection System: Overview
This is a real-time Cryptocurrency Anomaly Detection System designed to monitor major cryptocurrency markets (e.g., Bithumb) for suspicious trading activities. It features a Python backend that continuously collects market data and applies various algorithms to identify abnormal patterns, including:

Volatility Anomalies: Sudden, significant price changes.

Trend Deviations: Price movements that diverge sharply from established trends.

Wash Trading: Manipulative practices involving rapid, self-matching trades to inflate volume.

Order Book Manipulation (Large Walls): Detection of unusually large buy/sell orders that can influence market perception.

Spoofing: Placing large, non-intended orders to create false demand/supply, then canceling them before execution.

Pump and Dump Schemes: Identifying rapid price increases accompanied by abnormal trading volumes.

The system processes this data and provides real-time insights through a web-based dashboard, allowing users to visualize market conditions and receive alerts on detected anomalies.
